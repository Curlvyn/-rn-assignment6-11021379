**Project Overview:**
This React Native shopping cart app enables users to:
- View available products.
- Add items to their cart.
- Remove items from their cart.
- View the cart contents.
The app uses Local Storage (via AsyncStorage) to store selected items locally on the device.

**Design Choices:**
1. **React Native:**
   - Chosen for cross-platform capabilities and ease of mobile app development.
2. **Local Storage (AsyncStorage):**
   - Implemented for simplicity and performance.
3. **Component-Based Architecture:**
   - Functional components ensure modularity and reusability.
4. **State Management:**
   - React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks handle local state and lifecycle management.

**Screens and Components:**
- **HomeScreen:**
  - Lists available products.
  - Provides "Add to Cart" buttons.
- **CartScreen:**
  - Displays selected items.
  - Offers "Remove from Cart" buttons.
